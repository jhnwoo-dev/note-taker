# Express.js: note-taker

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create an application that would allow one to write and save notes.
This project solves the problem of a user not having an application that they could use to write and save important notes - all being done with express.js backend work.
I learned that you can keep a large portion of server requests on route files, which can reduce the amount of code on the main server.js file.

## Installation

You will need to clone the repo and run the 'npm i' command to install all the necessary items for the application to run.

## Usage

Once you find yourself on the localhost application, you can write your notes on the application and click on the save button to save the written note. You can also add a new note by clicking on the "+" button at the top right of the page to start a new note. If you have an existing note, you can delete the existing note.
